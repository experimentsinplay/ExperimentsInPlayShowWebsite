<b>Pruney Fingers</b> is an interactive picture book where you can see the world through a 9 year old girl's eyes. Hitting puberty, she is curious about her body and its sensations. But her journey to experore herself is not easy, due to all the biased and wrong information on female body. She gets lost, and needs your help! Based on actual, untold stories of my childhood I found in the little old diaries.
