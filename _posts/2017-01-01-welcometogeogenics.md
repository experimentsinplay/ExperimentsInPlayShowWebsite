Welcome dear employee #4811 to your first day here at <b>Geogenics</b>! Your job as a <b>Turing tester</b> is vital to the important work we do here, and makes sure that we stay on top of the game in artificial biodiversity. Try your hand at identifying real animals from ones created by our super powerful artificial intelligence! As we say here at <b>Geogenics</b>: who needs real animals when you can have endless machine generated birds?
