<b>Chapter 1</b> is an educational dungeon crawler designed to encourage young people to write their own stories and support their creative writing process.

Players journey to the depths of a jungle in search of adventure, encountering different objects and obstacles on their travels. The game requires players to write out their own solutions to these challenges using nothing more than a keyboard and their imagination.

The game tackles ‘blank page anxiety’ and other barriers preventing young people from engaging with creative writing in the classroom.
