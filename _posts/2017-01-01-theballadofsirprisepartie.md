<b>The Ballad of Sir Prisepartie</b> is a comedy text adventure game about a medieval knight tasked with planning the Princess' birthday party. Sir Prisepartie is a very gallant knight, but a very poor party planner. Help him plan the Princess' sixteenth birthday party using only your wit, your intuition, and a massive cupboard full of medieval weaponry.

Humorous writing! Captivating illustrations! Three endings, including a hidden horse ending! The Ballad of Sir Prisepartie is fun for all the family, and definitely one of the greatest pieces of interactive fiction about a party-planning knight.
