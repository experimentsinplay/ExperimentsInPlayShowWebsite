Noomi is setting out for her first summer at camp Pitch Pine. She’s a brave, daredevil, hero-in-training, and she is almost 100% certain that she did not sign up for a gardening programme...

<b>A Hero’s Guide To Gardening</b> is a game that teaches emotional literacy through your interactions with the characters and creatures you encounter during Noomi’s summer at camp. Through playable stories and dialogue, players discover different expressions of emotion, and learn strategies for coping with fear, anger, and sadness.
