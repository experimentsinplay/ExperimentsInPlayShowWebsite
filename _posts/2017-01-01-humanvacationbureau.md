What does your ideal life look like? What would you do differently next time around? What's stopping you from living the life you want right now?

<b>Human Vacation Bureau</b> is a booking system for souls planning their next human incarnation on earth. HVB allows you to choose a curated life experience "package" (e,g, cult leader, live saver, star-crossed lover, geologist) OR to create your own personalised life experience by choosing formative life events from the game's master list.
