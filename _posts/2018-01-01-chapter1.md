<b>Chapter 1</b> is an educational dungeon crawler designed to develop creativity in young people through creative writing. Players explore an overworld dungeon, encountering different obstacles that require the player to write out their own solutions using nothing more than a keyboard and their imagination.

The game uses natural language processing to generate new writing prompts based on what the player has already written, so the player slowly creates a story without realising it. The game tackles 'blank page anxiety' and other barriers preventing young people from engaging with creative writing in the classroom.
