<b>Nobody Cares What You Have To Say</b> is a satirical piece of interactive fiction that takes social media posts and examines the real stories behind them. Through its compendium of humorous short stories, the piece pokes fun at the banality and scope for misrepresentation that sits at the core of the social media experience.
