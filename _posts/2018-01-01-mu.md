<b>Mu</b> is a 24 year old stuck inside your living space, a small puff of cloud or smoke. She had locked herself in her room for the weekend, just smoking weed. The build up of humidity, human stink, and smoke literally condensed Mu into this meek being. She became what she smoked, and is now a smoky dank cloud. She must find her way back to her earth human self.

In the clouds that will form around you and the trails of her own clouds, she will find the answers in childhood memories.
