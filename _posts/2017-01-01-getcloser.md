<b>Get Closer</b> is a text adventure game about how to help a friend experiencing depression. The game takes the form of a conversation between the player and a frog trapped in a hole. The game is housed in a custom-built nest, and players must get down on the frog's level to communicate through dialogue options. The conversation tackles the difficulties of trying to build trust with someone who might be ashamed or resistant to help - and suggests different strategies for supporting a loved one who is struggling with poor mental health.

Get Closer won first place at the 2019 Global Game Jam for the London site.
