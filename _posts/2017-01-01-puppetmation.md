Animation for everyone! Do you have hands and/or enjoy using sock puppets? Then you can animate your own digital puppet show by slipping on this sock puppet! The camera will track the puppet's position, while sensors in its mouth will know when it's speaking. Pick your digital puppet, use your own voice, and put on a show to send to friends and family.
