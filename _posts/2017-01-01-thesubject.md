<b>The Subject</b> is an escape room game that seeks to take classic escape game tropes and minimise them to a smaller scale - the game takes place inside a small, dark box.

The game is designed for two or more players: one player is locked inside the box, and the other players have to help them escape. Inside the box is a torch, and a succession of cryptic messages and clues written across the walls. Outside the box; a coded lockbox, and another series of documents. Players must cooperate to piece together the different information available, solve the game's puzzles and unlock the box.
