<b>SFL - Screaming for London</b> is a new initiative providing the people of London with access to unrepressed screaming. We collect and monitor screams for quality and assurance purposes, and to provide analytic data on the causes of screaming. We regularly update our directory to include new reasons to scream as they arise.
