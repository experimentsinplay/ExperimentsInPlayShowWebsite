<b>Wonderland</b> is a stylised version of ​Alice in Wonderland, with a focus on the size changing mechanic. This is a story about a young boy’s journey from a normal world into an abstract world and back home again. He needs to change his size to find the way out, all whilst solving various puzzles.
